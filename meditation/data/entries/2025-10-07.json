  "notes": "The saying, \"A crooked tree lives its own life, but a straight tree is turned into wood,\" originates from the ancient Chinese Taoist text, the Zhuangzi, dating back to the 4th century BC. \nIt appears in the book as a parable told by the philosopher Zhuangzi to illustrate the concept of the \"usefulness of uselessness\". The original text does not phrase it as a common proverb, but recounts a story involving Zhuangzi and a carpenter. \nThe original parable\nThere are slightly different versions, but the core story in the Zhuangzi is as follows:\nA carpenter and his apprentice come across a massive, old oak tree that is gnarled and crooked.\nThe apprentice is amazed by the tree's size, but the carpenter dismisses it as worthless, explaining that its wood is too knotted and twisted to be used for anything, so it was never cut down.\nLater, the tree appears to the carpenter in a dream and defends its \"uselessness.\" It explains that because useful trees—like cherry or apple trees—are harvested for their fruit or timber, they don't get to live out their natural lives.\nThe oak tree, by embracing its uselessness, has lived for centuries, providing shade and serving a different, less conventional purpose. \nThe philosophical argument\nZhuangzi and his friend Huizi also debate the concept directly in the text. Huizi criticizes Zhuangzi's teachings as \"useless,\" to which Zhuangzi responds with a parable about a large, gnarled tree. He suggests planting the tree in a vast, empty wilderness where people can rest under its shade, protected because no one desires its wood. This story highlights a central theme of Taoism: that a single-minded focus on conventional utility is a limited and often dangerous way to view the world. "
